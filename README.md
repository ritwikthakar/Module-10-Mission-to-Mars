## Overvie of the Analysis
The purose of this activity is to adjust Mission to Mars webpage to include all four of the planet's hemisphere images. To do this, we have used BeautifulSoup and Splinter ans scraped full-resolution images of Marsâ€™s hemispheres and the titles of those images, stored the scraped data on a Mongo database, used a web application to display the data, and altered the design of the web app to accommodate these images.
